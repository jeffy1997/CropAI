# CropAI
Crop disease prediction using deep learning

Use Case:
Farmers lack an efficient way of easily detecting crop diseases which leads them to lose their entire produce. This affects close to 40% of Global crop production and costs the global economy around $220 billion. (Source: United Nations) Expensive agronomist are required to travel long distances to access farmers crop fields to diagnose simple diseases and limited agricultural personnel to recommend pesticides to treat their crops
Despite the various technological advancements there is no feasible solution that has been implemented at a large scale to combat this problem which will only become larger as food production increases due to increase in population.

Solution:
An application that uses artificial intelligence to detect crop diseases, provide the appropriate disease diagnostic to farmers.
Recommendation to farmers on the appropriate pesticide (organic preferred) to treat the diseases.
Providing farmers, a simple platform with means of purchasing the pesticides and having it delivered to their crop fields.

An end to end solution to combat decrease in global crop production and global economy amidst growing food production demand.

Possible Future Work:
Drones to survey the agricultural field and capture images of plants with diseases
Images are continuously streamed to a storage and an AI model analyzes the image to find the right pesticide.
Another set of drones spray the right amount of pesticide to the right crop by considering the wind speeds.
